# Pokedex
*A small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.*

### Technical Requirements:

- The app loads data from an external API.
- The app displays a list of items loaded from that API after the page is loaded.
- The app enables the viewing of more details for a given list item (like a Pokémon) on
demand, such as when clicking on a list item.
- The app has CSS styling.
- The JavaScript code is formatted according to ESLint rules.
- The JavaScript code is formatted via Prettier.
- The JavaScript code is manually formatted.
- The app uses at least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for details or
touch interactions.
- The app allows searching for items (e.g., searching for Pokémon).
- The app throws any errors when being used.
- The app is deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub Pages (you can
review how to do this in Intro to Frontend Development's Exercise 10: Code Quality, Testing, &
Web Hosting).
- The app works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.
